# How I Created a Hybrid Cache Handler for iOS

When building performant iOS applications, caching plays a crucial role in reducing load times, minimizing network usage, and improving the overall user experience. In my app [**Nester**](https://nester.co.il), I needed to render neighborhood polygons using **MapKit**. These polygons were represented as `MKPolygon` overlays, which are essential for the app‚Äôs **"Select Regions"** flow‚Äîthe first interaction users trigger after launching the app.

To address this, I built a **custom caching layer** that supports both **memory** and **disk caching**. This solution ensured that neighborhood polygons were available immediately, without any delay, and provided flexibility for future updates.

In this post, I‚Äôll walk you through how I created this **hybrid cache handler**, the challenges faced, and the problem it solved for the Nester app.

## üöÄ Problem: Large GeoJSON Files for Neighborhood Polygons

In Nester, the **GeoJSON files** that define neighborhood polygons are quite large (around **2.6MB** in total). These files are required to render the map and display the neighborhoods for the "Select Regions" flow, which is the first interaction users trigger after launching the app.

I wanted the **initial user experience** to be **instant**‚Äîensuring users could immediately interact with the map, without any delays waiting for data to load from the network or disk.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution: Hybrid Cache Handler for Memory and Disk

To solve this problem, I designed a **custom cache handler** that allows me to cache both in-memory and on-disk. Here‚Äôs how it works:

- **Disk Cache**: On the first launch, the cache handler checks if the required data (neighborhood polygons) is already stored on disk. If not, it loads the data from **preloaded files** bundled with the app and saves them to the disk cache.
- **Memory Cache**: Once the data is cached on disk, it‚Äôs also loaded into **memory** for fast retrieval on subsequent app launches. This ensures that data is available **instantly** the next time the user interacts with the "Select Regions" feature, without any network lag.
- **Preloaded Cache**: This approach allows me to bundle the GeoJSON data inside the app, so even if the user is offline, they can immediately access the required polygons.

This **hybrid approach** (combining memory and disk caching) improved the **app‚Äôs responsiveness** while maintaining **scalability** for future updates. The solution also allowed me to release new cities via the backend or bundle them with the app in future updates, all while ensuring the app remains **performant**.

### Why Not Use NSURLCache or Alamofire Cache?

You might wonder why I didn‚Äôt simply rely on `NSURLCache` or Alamofire‚Äôs built-in caching mechanisms. While both options are useful for caching HTTP responses, they **weren't flexible enough** for my use case. Here‚Äôs why:

- **NSURLCache**: This is designed for caching HTTP responses, not arbitrary data or custom objects like GeoJSON files. Additionally, it doesn‚Äôt give you full control over data expiration or the ability to cache complex data types.
- **Alamofire Cache**: While Alamofire‚Äôs caching can handle network responses, I needed more control over how and where I cache **non-network data**. I also required both **memory and disk caching**, with the ability to expire cache based on timestamps, which Alamofire doesn‚Äôt support out of the box.

Thus, building a custom caching system gave me **fine-grained control** over how data was stored, loaded, and expired, enabling me to deliver a smoother user experience.

## üß© Key Features of the CacheHandler

Here are the key aspects of the `CacheHandler` class that make it flexible and efficient:

### 1. **Memory Caching**

```swift
private let memoryCache = NSCache<NSString, AnyObject>()
```

The `NSCache` class provides a fast, in-memory cache that automatically handles memory warnings by evicting objects when the system is under pressure. This makes it perfect for caching objects that are accessed frequently but do not need to persist across app launches.

### 2. **Disk Caching with Expiration**

```swift
private func saveResponseToDisk(_ response: AnyObject, forKey key: String) { ... }

private func loadResponseFromDisk(forKey key: String) -> AnyObject? { ... }
```

This function handles saving and retrieving data to/from disk. The data is stored using a SHA256 hash of the cache key, ensuring filenames are unique and safe for filesystem storage. Additionally, we check the **modification date** of the file to automatically **expire** old cached files after a set period (6 days in this case).

### 3. **Preloaded Cache**

```swift
private func copyPreloadedCacheIfNeeded() { ... }
```

When the app starts, the cache handler checks if there are preloaded files bundled with the app. If so, it copies them to the disk cache. This ensures that essential data is immediately available, even if the user is offline or if the app has just been installed.

## ‚ö° Usage Example

Here‚Äôs how you can use the `CacheHandler` class in your app:

### Saving a Response to Cache

```swift
let key = "user-profile-123"
let jsonResponse: AnyObject = ...

// Save response to both memory and disk caches
CacheHandler.shared.cacheResponse(jsonResponse, forKey: key, cacheOptions: [.memory, .disk])
```

### Retrieving a Cached Response

```swift
if let cached = CacheHandler.shared.getCachedResponse(forKey: key, cacheOptions: [.memory, .disk]) {
    // Use the cached data immediately
}
```

This simple interface allows you to choose whether to cache data in memory, on disk, or both, providing flexibility for your app‚Äôs performance needs.

## ‚ö° Integration with AlamoFire Example

Integrating the `CacheHandler` class into your networking flow can significantly enhance your app's performance by reducing redundant network requests and loading times. Below are examples of how to save and retrieve cached responses using the `CacheHandler`:

### Saving a Response to Cache

When you receive a response that you wish to cache, you can save it using the `CacheHandler`. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
import Alamofire

// Define your API endpoint and parameters
let endpoint = "https://api.example.com/data"
let parameters: Parameters = ["key": "value"]

// Generate a cache key based on the endpoint and parameters
let cacheKey = endpoint + (parameters.description)

// Attempt to retrieve cached response
if let cachedResponse = CacheHandler.shared.getCachedResponse(forKey: cacheKey, cacheOptions: [.memory, .disk]) {
    // Use the cached data immediately
    handleResponse(cachedResponse)
} else {
    // Perform the network request
    AF.request(endpoint, method: .get, parameters: parameters)
        .validate()
        .responseJSON { response in
            switch response.result {
            case .success(let value):
                // Cache the new response
                CacheHandler.shared.cacheResponse(value as AnyObject, forKey: cacheKey, cacheOptions: [.memory, .disk])
                handleResponse(value)
            case .failure(let error):
                // Handle error
                print("Request failed with error: \(error)")
            }
        }
}
```

In this example:

- **Cache Key Generation:** A unique `cacheKey` is created by concatenating the endpoint URL and the description of the parameters. This ensures that each request has a distinct key, allowing for precise caching.

- **Cache Retrieval:** Before making a network request, the cache is checked for an existing response using the generated `cacheKey`. If a cached response is found, it is used immediately, providing a faster user experience.

- **Network Request:** If no cached response is found, a network request is made using Alamofire's `AF.request`. Upon receiving a successful response, the data is cached for future use.

This approach provides a flexible caching mechanism that integrates seamlessly with Alamofire, accommodating various networking configurations. By utilizing the `CacheHandler`, you can enhance your app's performance and ensure a smooth user experience. 

## üèÅ Conclusion

Building a custom caching solution for my iOS app, **Nester**, was essential for delivering a **fast and smooth user experience** when dealing with large GeoJSON files. By creating a **hybrid cache handler** that supports both **memory and disk caching**, I was able to ensure that neighborhood polygons were available **immediately** after app launch, with no network delays.

This caching strategy also allowed for flexibility in how data is loaded and updated. I can release new cities via the backend or ship them in future app updates ‚Äî all while keeping performance high and scalable.
